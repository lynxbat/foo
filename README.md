# **Pulse** <sup><sub>_A powerful telemetry agent framework from Intel Corporation &reg;_</sub></sup>
[![Build Status](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/intelsdi-x/pulse.svg?token=2ujsxEpZo1issFyVWX29&branch=master)](https://magnum.travis-ci.com/intelsdi-x/pulse)

## Description

**Pulse** is a framework for enabling the gathering of telemetry from systems. The goal of this project is:

* Improve the deployment model and flexibility of a telemetry tools.
* Allow dynamic control of collection for one system or many at once.
* Make it easy to inject processing on telemetry at the agent for use cases like machine learning.
* Reduce the friction of pointing Pulse to any telemetry ingesting system.
* Provide operational improvements that make collecting on a very large cluster of systems easier.

**Pulse** provides several specific features:

* Three types of plugins: collectors, processors, and publishers.
* Open plugin model allows for loading built-in, community, or proprietary plugins into **Pulse**.
* Dynamic loading, unloading, and swapping of plugins.
* Adding a newer version of a plugin automatically upgrades the next scheduled actions _(when not pinned to a version)_.
* Powerful control using viral clustering of **Pulse** instances into a Tribe.
* Ability to run **Pulse** in distributed role deployment models.
* Extensible source allowing addition of extended scheduling, plugins, routing, and more.
* Multiple management modules including: CLI, REST API, and Web Console. Each of which can be turned on or off.
* CLI control from OSX, Windows, or Linux.

**Pulse** is not intended to:

* Operate as an analytics platform. The intention is to allow plugins for feeding those platforms.
* Compete with existing metric/monitoring/telemetry agents. It is simply a new option to use or reference.

Here are some blog posts related to ***Pulse*** by the team:

* Nickapedia.com - [What if collecting data center telemetry was a snap?](http://nickapedia.com/2015/12/02/what-if-collecting-data-center-telemetry-was-a-snap/)

**Pulse** needs:

* _Feedback_: try it and tell us about it.
* _Contributors_: We need plugins, schedules, testing, and more.
* _Integrations_: **Pulse** can feasibly publish to almost any destination. We need publishing plugins for [Ceilometer](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Ceilometer), [vCOPs](http://www.vmware.com/products/vrealize-operations), and more.

**Pulse** architecture

* Decoupled internal structure with a focus on event-driven handling
